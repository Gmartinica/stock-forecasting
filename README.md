# LSTM/GRU Model for Stock Price Prediction

This project uses deep learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to predict stock prices for companies that I have invested in. The model is trained on historical stock price data, news sentiment, and macroeconomic variables like interest rate and yield spreads to generate input/output pairs for training. The resulting trained model can then be used to make predictions on future stock prices.
